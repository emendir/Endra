# Endra

A peer-to-peer encrypted messaging protocol supporting multiple devices per user.

See the EndraApp project for a GUI messaging application for desktop and mobile implementing Endra.

## Features

- fully peer to peer, no servers of any kind
- can function independently of internet connectivity
- full end-to-end encryption ephemeral keys, algorithm-agnostic & future-proof
- multiple devices per profile (user account)
- multiple profiles per device
- can be used as a library for embedding into other applications
- will become part of an expandable ecosystem incl. calendar and file-sharing
- [app for desktop and mobile](https://github.com/emendir/EndraApp) (tested on Linux (Ubuntu x86-64) and Android (arm-64))

## Project Status **EXPERIMENTAL**

This library is very early in its development.

The API of this library IS LIKELY TO CHANGE in the near future!
